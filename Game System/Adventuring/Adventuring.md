# Actions
In general, when you attempt to do anything you perform an action.
This action is resolved with a [[../Gameplay/Gameplay#Check Success & Failure|check]], with the check's results determining the action's results.

## Concentration ([[../Characters/Attributes/Willpower (WIL)|WIL]] + [[../Characters/Attributes/Resolve (RES)|RES]])
Concentration is the ability to focus on a task regardless of your environment and/or other interactions.

Sometimes you may be interrupted or distracted by others or the environment, or the action you are performing may be so intricate that you need to concentrate actively to perform it. In these cases you must succeed on a concentration check, with difficulty either defined by the situation or the [[../Gameplay/Gameplay#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|DoS]].
> For example, you need a concentration check when:
> - driving and talking on the phone simultaneously
> - affecting an active spell of your own in some way
> - suffering damage when trying to take a non-combat action

Concentration can also be used to eliminate or reduce the penalties of [[../Gameplay/Gameplay#Multitasking|multitasking]].
