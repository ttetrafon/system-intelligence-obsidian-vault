# Actions
In general, when you attempt to do anything you perform an action.
This action is resolved with a [[../Gameplay/Gameplay#Check Success & Failure|check]], with the check's results determining the action's results.

## Concentration ([[../Characters/Attributes/Willpower (WIL)|WIL]] + [[../Characters/Attributes/Resolve (RES)|RES]])
Concentration is the ability to focus on a task regardless of your environment and/or other interactions.

Sometimes you may be interrupted or distracted by others or the environment, or the action you are performing may be so intricate that you need to concentrate actively to perform it. In these cases you must succeed on a concentration check, with difficulty either defined by the situation or the [[../Gameplay/Gameplay#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|DoS]].
> For example, you need a concentration check when:
> - driving and talking on the phone simultaneously
> - affecting an active spell of your own in some way
> - suffering damage when trying to take a non-combat action

Concentration can also be used to eliminate or reduce the penalties of [[../Gameplay/Gameplay#Multitasking|multitasking]].

# Adventuring Activities

## Foraging, Salvaging, Scrapping, Disenchanting…
All these are resolved in a similar way. You make an appropriate [[../Gameplay/Gameplay|check]] and spend the time required in each activity.
The [[../Gameplay/Gameplay#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|DoS]] of this check is then used as that target of an [[../Gameplay/Resources/Resources#Accumulation|accumulation]] check for the appropriate [[../Gameplay/Resources/Resources|resource(s)]].

#### Disenchanting
Disenchanting is destroying pre-existing ❗enchantments to get the materials back.

#### Foraging
Foraging is about harvesting natural materials, food, and/or clean water in the wilderness.

#### Hunting
Hunting is taking down prey, either by attacking directly or setting traps up.

#### Salvaging
Salvaging describes all activities required to strip useful materials from pre-existing constructions, like buildings or derelict vehicles.

#### Scrapping
Scrapping is disassembling equipment to their base material.
