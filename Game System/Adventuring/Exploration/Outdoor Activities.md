# Holding your Breath
You may need to hold your breath in various situations, like when diving underwater or when you find suddenly in the void of the space without equipment.
After some specific period of time, usually a [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping#Turn|turn]], you need to succeed on a [[../../Characters/Aspects/Traversal|Traversal]] + [[../../Characters/Attributes/Endurance (END)|END]] check to not inhale forcefully, which may cause ❗suffocation or other adverse effects depending on the situation.
The [[../../Gameplay/Gameplay#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|difficulty]] of this check begins at 1 and increases by +1 at each interval you need to repeat this check.
If you suffer any ❗damage while holding your breath, you must immediately repeat this check.
