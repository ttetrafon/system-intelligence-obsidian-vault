Overland travel…

## Navigation
Navigating while traveling is not always an easy or straightforward task. Whether traveling on land, at sea, on air, or in space, you always need some way to find your way, even when you have technology or magic at hand that helps with the task.

### Teleportation
Navigation in the [[../../../World/Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Spirit (Aether)/Spirit (Aether)|Aether]] is even required while using ❗teleportation magic.
When teleporting to larger [[Exploration#Distances|distances]], you do not travel immediately to your destination - instead you have to move through a number of biomes (as shown in each distance grouping). While in these, even though your magic guides you, you still need to find your way through.
Typically, passing through a single biome, if there is no [[Exploration#Difficult Terrain|difficult terrain]] encountered, takes about a quarter day - but the total real time spent in the teleportation is the one denoted in each distance grouping.
> For example, teleporting to the other side of Earth takes, for external observers, 1d10+1 seconds. But for you, that needs to pass through a random Aether biome, will take at least a quarter day.
