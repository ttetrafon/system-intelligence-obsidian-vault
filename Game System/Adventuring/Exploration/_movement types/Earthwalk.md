You can move by sliding through earth as if it you are moving on land.
You cannot earthwalk in all materials; your ability depends on your race or the way you got this movement mode, and may be restricted.
> The ground passes around and through you in the most unsettling way possible. It is suffering a slow-moving sandblasting. You feel the earth grinding at every part of your body, and your clothes do not make any difference. Even your taste and smell are overwhelmed by strong mineral sensations.
