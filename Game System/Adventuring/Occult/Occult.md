# Occult Skills
â€¦

If you are trained in the occult, you can detect the uncanny, the unnatural, and the unwholesome. You may notice that you have entered a haunted house, or that someone is using magic to observe you, or even that the one you are speaking to is cursed or mind controlled. This operates as a sixth sense, and but you generally need to concentrate to it.
