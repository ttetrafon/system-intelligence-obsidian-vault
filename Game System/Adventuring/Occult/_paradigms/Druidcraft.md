You get magic powers by symbiosis with Nature and the Spirit world. A druid is someone that tends to the land and its beasts, regardless of their disposition. Such links are what empower a druid's magical powers.

Druids always form well-structured druidic circles, with each individual playing a vital role in the organisation and survival of the group. A druidic circle usually encompasses vast areas of land and water, most usually a whole continent.

Each druidic circle builds 10 groves, one for each ❗seed rune, plus one to act as the anchor for the circle, binding all the other groves together. Each grove contains 10 stones, each one representing one of the ❗runes of power.

### Druidic Ranks
- ***Archdruid***: One druid that leads the circle.
- ***Grand Druid***: Two individuals trained in the Archdruid's responsibilities, ready to succeed them while taking part in the circle's governance.
- ***Great Druid***: A master of a magic seed. As such, there are always 11 great druids in the circle. Usually, each great druid is responsible for a single grove.
- ***Druid***: A druid is an accomplished practitioner of magic capable of performing the rituals, spells, and other religious activities of a community, and has mastered at least a few esoteric arts between the arts of astronomy, astrology, divination, natural philosophy, and so on.
- ***Bard***: A bard is a druid that does mingle with the local communities, unlike typical druids acting as representatives of the circle and facilitating communication between the circle and the common people. To be a bard, one must have mastered the oral traditions of storytelling, poetry, genealogies, and law-speaking.
- ***Ovate***: A druid in training that will end up either a bard or a druid.
- ***Wicca***: Practitioners of druidic magic are not always associated with a druidic circle - they have either left their circle, were excommunicated by their circle, or never had any contact with a circle at all. These wicca, often called witches (female) and warlocks (male) are not accomplished in the druidic way, but have access to esoteric knowledge and can pass as druids. They do not recognise any outside authority. They sometimes form covens, loose gatherings of wicca connected for some reason.
