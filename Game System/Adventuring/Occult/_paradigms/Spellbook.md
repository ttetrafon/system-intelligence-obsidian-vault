You keep the seeds you learn and spells you learned in a spellbook, which you need at hand to cast any spell you have developed.
The spellbook operates as a medium to the spells you have developed, and as such you do not need to actually read a spell when casting it, but it needs to be there.
If you do not have the spellbook at hand, you cannot cast spells at all.
