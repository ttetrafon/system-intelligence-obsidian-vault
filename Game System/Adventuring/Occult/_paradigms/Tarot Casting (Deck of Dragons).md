By attuning to a [[../../../Characters/Morality/Deck of Dragons|Deck of Dragons]] you gain access to powerful magic.

First you gain access to the ‚ùófate seed, which you can use normally to cast spells and effects.

After you have completed your training in the fate seed, you can expand your arsenal of magic accessible through the deck's cards. You can develop spells and tie them in the cards. Each card can hold one spell per ???, with a maximum ML based on the card's suit and value. You can use all spells on a card simultaneously, once per encounter, by drawing the card. This spellcasting does not require a successful [[../Occult#Spellcasting|spellcraft]] check.
You can recast these spells during the same encounter, but you must succeed on Spellcraft checks during subsequent attempts.
