# Science Skills
Regardless of the specific scientific skills and knowledge one may gain when studying any discipline, scientists gain a few other skills shared by all disciplines.

### Library Search
Sometimes, instead of knowing something, you may look for it in some structured or compiled repository of knowledge, like a library, a database, or even the internet. This skill, usually referred as library search, is a skill not many can master but is very useful nevertheless within organised societies.
