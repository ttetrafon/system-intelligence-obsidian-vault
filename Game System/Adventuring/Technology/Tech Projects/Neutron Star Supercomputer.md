- take a black hole and surround it with red-dwarves on a specific configuration, plus one white dwarf
- matter flowing in follows specific trajectories, one of which blends time & space in such a way that the matter moving on it flows back in time
- this matter reaches the birth of the black hole, and the pressure it adds in the supernovae changes the equilibrium
- the changed equilibrium denies the creation of a black hole and sends ripples of causal shock propagating back into the future
- these ripples of causal shock meet with the incoming matter and establish a wave extending symmetrically over past and future simultaneously
- enmeshed in this grid, the collapsed star is no longer a black hole but instead collapses down to a stable configuration of strange quarks and degenerate neutrons, flickering between the two states intermittently
- externally it resembles a neutron star, but internally the crystal matter has formed an intricate computation device, running in parallel with itself through time
- because of this, it now things for itself
- the white dwarf in orbit meanwhile, tidally locked on the matter-time trajectory, now collapses into an aperture allowing thinking creatures to interface with the processor - by transforming anyone interfacing with it into information momentarily, both scanning them totally and talking with them
- the interface also reads all information that arrives through any type of emission that reaches it
