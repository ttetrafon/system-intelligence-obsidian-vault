- an array of machines and chambers built atop an active volcano
- when gases are released from the volcano, (genetically modified) algae are released into the stream
- the algae then transform the gases into a breathable mixture during the gases' dispersion
- if put strategically all over a planet/satellite they can quickly make the atmosphere breathable, but need to stay in place, otherwise the situation will be reverted soon enough
