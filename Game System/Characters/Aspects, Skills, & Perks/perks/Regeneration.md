Regeneration allows for extremely fast [[../../Health/Health#Recovery|health recovery]].
You gain the following benefits every [[../../../Gameplay & Timekeeping/Gameplay & Timekeeping#Turn|turn]].
- Restore all [[../../Health/Health#Wounds & Injuries|wounds]] automatically.
- Restore up to N [[../../Health/Health#Wounds & Injuries|injury]], [[../../Health/Health#Banes|bane]], and [[../../Health/Health#Conditions|condition]] severity levels, as long as they allow for recovery.
Furthermore, you can never become [[../../Health/Incapacitated|incapacitated]] or ❗dying while your regeneration lasts.

- [!] If you suffer damage from something you are ❗vulnerable to, you lose your regeneration for the next turn.
