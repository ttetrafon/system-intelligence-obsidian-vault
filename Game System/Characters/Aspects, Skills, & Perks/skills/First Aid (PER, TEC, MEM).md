Medical procedures allows you to perform the simplest of operations, like treating an open wound, cleaning a snake bite, placing a splinter on a broken bone, etc. First aid must happen during the same [[../../../Gameplay & Timekeeping/Gameplay & Timekeeping#Encounter|encounter]], or immediately after. A successful first aid check removes its [[../../../Checks & Dice/Checks & Dice#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|degree of success]] in severity levels from a [[../../Health/Health#Wounds & Injuries|wound]], or one severity level from a number of wounds equal to the DoS.

- [!] A single creature can be the recipient of a first aid check only once per [[../../../Gameplay & Timekeeping/Gameplay & Timekeeping#Encounter|encounter]].

- [!] First aid cannot be used to reduce [[../../Health/Fatigue (body)|fatigue (body)]], [[../../Health/Fatigue (mind)|fatigue (mind)]], or [[../../Health/Fatigue (soul)|fatigue (soul)]].
