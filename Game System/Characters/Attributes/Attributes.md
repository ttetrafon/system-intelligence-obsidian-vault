A number of attributes describes your overall prowess with any type of action. Each of them is used to perform different actions and features its own score (d4, d6, d8, â€¦). Attributes are what you usually roll when making checks.
Attributes are divided in three categories called attribute traits, **Body**, **Mind**, **Spirit**. Each trait is assigned its relevant category score ([[#Body|body]], ,[[#Mind|mind]], [[#Soul|soul]]).

Attributes are always part of any [[../../Gameplay/Checks & Dice|check]] you make during the game.

## Category/Trait Score
Each category ([[#Body]]/[[#Mind]]/[[#Soul]]) also has its own score, equal to the median of its attribute scores or [[Endurance (END)|END]]/[[Willpower (WIL)|WIL]]/[[Resolve (RES)|RES]], whichever is higher.
> For example, your Mind attributes are d8/d4/d12/d20/d6, so your Mind score is d8.
> Similarly, if your scores where instead d8/d4/d6/d20/d12, your Mind score would be d12 since the median of d8 is lower than your current WIL score.

- [I] A trait score is updated immediately when any of its attributes changes.
