Your character belongs to one of the following age categories; you do not keep close track of your age.

Every time you advance an age category, your attributes are changed, either positively or negatively.
- **infant**: -
- **child**: body +1d10, mind +1d10, spirit +1d10
- **adolescent**: body +1d10, mind +1d10, spirit +1d10
- **young adult**: body +1d10, mind +1d10, spirit +1d10
- **adult I-V**: body -1d10, mind +1d10, spirit +1d10
- **venerable** I-II: body -1d10, mind -1d10, spirit -1d10

As you adventure, every # cycles (# depends on species) you make an END check (regular). When you fail three of these checks in total, you immediately get to the next age category. On a fumble, you instead immediately move to the next age category. When you succeed on this check, the next check has its [[../../../Checks & Dice/Checks & Dice#Success & Failure|difficulty]] increased by 1 step.

Regardless of the age category you belong to, if you are really long lived you gain an automatic (cumulative) increase on all your attributes pools. Note that these increase on ❗Body❗ characteristics are relevant only while you are juvenile or an adult; if already venerable, you gain increases only on your ❗Mental❗ and ❗Spirit❗ attributes.
- +1d10/500 years, up to 10000 years
- +1d10/1000 years, up to 100000 years
- +1d10/10000 years, up to 1000000 years
- +1d10/100000 years
