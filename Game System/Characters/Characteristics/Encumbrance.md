Encumbrance is determined by your attributes and your size; it is equal to *max(Mig, Dex) * 4 ^ ([[../../Checks & Dice/Bonuses & Penalties/Size|Size]] - 1)*.

Carried and worn items occupy an amount of your encumbrance equal to their [[../../Checks & Dice/Bonuses & Penalties/Size|bulk]]. Some items with the ❗heavy (#) or ❗light (#) properties may differ from this.
