Encumbrance is determined by your attributes and your size; it is equal to *max(Mig, Dex) * 4 ^ ([[../../Checks & Dice/Bonuses & Penalties/Size|Size]] - 1)*.

Carried and worn items occupy an amount of your encumbrance equal to their [[../../Checks & Dice/Bonuses & Penalties/Size|bulk]]. Some items with the ❗heavy (#) or ❗light (#) properties may differ from this.

You are considered ❗encumbered as you carry more and more items and your encumbrance increases compared to your maximum calculated above (at 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4).
> For example, as a human with Mig 4, Dex 5, and size 5, you have an encumbrance score of 320/640/960/1280.
