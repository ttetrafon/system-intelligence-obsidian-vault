Encumbrance is determined by your [[Size/Size|size]] and ❗species, and then modified by your [[../Attributes/Attributes|attributes]].

Carried and worn items occupy a number of slots equal to their [[Size/Size|size]].
Items with the ❗heavy or ❗light properties differ from the above, as noted in each case.

You are considered ❗encumbered as you carry more and more items and your encumbrance increases compared to your maximum calculated above (at 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4).
