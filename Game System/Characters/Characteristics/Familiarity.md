When you interact with technology or magic you don't know, i.e. of a tier higher than your current ❗TK/❗ML you suffer huge disadvantages on your skill checks.

Regardless of your current aptitude tier though you may gain familiarity with specific equipment or effects by solely using them for some time.
Familiarity is a [[../../Gameplay/Resources|score]] you train until you reach the target.
The target is usually equal to the difference between your own ❗TK/❗MA and the target's ❗TL/❗ML respectively, unless otherwise defined by the GM due to other factors (like complexity or ease of use).
> For example...

When interacting with something you are gaining familiarity with, you add your familiarity to your ❗TK/❗MA to determine any relevant penalties on your actions.

When you get a new piece of unknown tech or magic, but you already are familiar with something very similar, your familiarity score for the new item starts at half of the familiarity you already have in that similar thing.
