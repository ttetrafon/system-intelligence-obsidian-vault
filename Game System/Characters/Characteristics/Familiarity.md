When you interact with technology or magic you don't know, i.e. of a tier higher than your current [[../Tiers/Technology Knowledge (TK)|TK]] or [[../Tiers/Magic Aptitude (MA)|MA]] you suffer a huge disadvantages on your skill checks.

Regardless of your current aptitude tier though you may gain familiarity with specific equipment or effects by solely using them for some time.

You gain familiarity on a specific thing in place of gaining experience on something else like normal. The familiarity score is considered an [[../Attributes/Attributes|attribute]], and you make a familiarity check before interacting with the thing it applies to; if you succeed on this check you do not suffer the usual disadvantages of using unknown tech or magic.

When you get a new piece of unknown tech or magic, but you already are familiar with something very similar, your familiarity score for the new item starts at half of the familiarity you already have in that similar thing (max 50).
