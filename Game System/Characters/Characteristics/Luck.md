Your luck describes how fortunate you are through your life.

Luck is a [[../../Gameplay/Resources|resource]] that fluctuates widely throughout your adventuring career.
You gain more luck after every [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping#Scene|scene]]; after each scene you make an [[../../Gameplay/Resources#Accumulation|accumulation]] check for free.

You can [[../../Gameplay/Resources#Expenditure|spend]] your luck to achieve the following effects:
- **Nudge Fate**: After knowing the result of a skill check, you can spend points of luck to modify the result. You roll an expenditure check of any level you wish, up to your current luck. The expenditure part is then applied to your skill check as a [[../../Gameplay/Bonuses & Penalties/Luck|luck]] [[../../Gameplay/Bonuses & Penalties/Bonuses & Penalties|bonus]].
- **Avoid Harm**: Spend 2 to resist any harm you have just suffered in a [turn](onenote:#Gameplay%20%20Time%20Keeping&section-id={F4B5F533-AED8-4749-B5F7-808512A72D86}&page-id={E4098861-C5E8-48E6-AC40-5915347D3380}&object-id={4E26C052-ECC6-0FA3-299D-234B4D3144D4}&3A&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/73fbda111a4ef6fc/Documents/System%20Intelligence/Game%20System.one).
- **Flashback**: Spend 3 to recall a [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping#Planning & Flashbacks|flashback]] at a point you are not normally allowed to do so.
- **I Know a Guy**: Spend 3 to invoke an *I know a guy situation*. In any situation that it makes sense, you can declare that you know someone and proceed to define your connection to them, their personality and characteristics, their whereabouts, and the help you expect to have from them.
> For example, you may looking for a contact in the thieves guild to fence all your illegal treasures. You may declare that once, when growing up in the city streets, you were saved by the renowned Shadow Thief, and that he keeps tabs with your from time to time. He may be your link to the Thieves' Guild, or he may be able to point you to the proper direction.
- [I] Note that this will usually lead into a separate, secondary quest and is not a free pass for your problem at hand.
- **Change Fate**: All your group present in a situation can spend 5 each to change an event's outcome. You decide what you want to happen in broad strokes, and that reality takes effect immediately. This can apply to non-immediate circumstances only, and the change must be plausible. You do not decide the fine details of it though; you paint the events in general strokes and the GM extrapolates the details that fit in the world and the current story.
> For example, you are in the middle of a quest to save an abductee from a cult, but you arrive too late to stop the sacrifice. You can use this ability to overrule that outcome, and instead say that something happened, like a monster attack or some disagreement between the cultists, and the sacrifice has been delayed, allowing you to arrive at the nick of time.
