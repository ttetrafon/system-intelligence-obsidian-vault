# Character Creation
A character is the main unit of gameplay, alongside [[../../Organisations/Organisations|organisations]]. Both players and GM create characters who interact between themselves and with the environment.

To create a character, follow these steps:

1. Origin
	1. Choose your ‚ùóspecies.
	2. Decide where you come from in very general steps.
2. Name & Ancestry
	1. Select your name
	2. Describe your family and your cultural background.
3. [[Attributes/Attributes|Attributes]]
	1. Define your starting attributes according to your species parameters.
4. [[Characteristics/Characteristics|Characteristics]]
	1. [[Characteristics/Luck|Luck]]: 
	2. [[Characteristics/Size/Size|Size]]: 
5. [[Characteristics/Age|Age]] & Background
	1. Decide the age you will start adventuring. Depending on your ancestry and childhood, gain the appropriate background aspect(s).
	2. Then go through the background intervals until you reach that age. For each background interval, decide what your character will be doing in broad strokes.
	3. For each age category you advance, describe your plans for that age bracket, and follow the steps according to your choices.
