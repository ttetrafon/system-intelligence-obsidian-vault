You gain experience either by adventuring or living your life.

You can increase any of the following, either after a [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Scene|scene]], or as a [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Downtime Activities|downtime activity]].
When you gain the chance to train, select one of the following and attempt an [[../../Gameplay/Resources/Resources#Accumulation|accumulation check]] to increase your selection. During adventuring, the target may be higher, but most often it is just the minimum on your current score.
- [[../Aspects/Aspects|Aspects]] 
- [[../Characteristics/Familiarity|Familiarity]]
- [[../../Adventuring/Social/Language|Languages]]
- [[../Morality/Morality|Morality]]
- [[../Perks/Perks|Perks]]

You can attempt to increase your [[../Attributes/Attributes|Attributes]] every time you have successfully increased any other stat from the above. The attribute you may select needs to be related to what has been just increased successfully.
