As an adventurer you oftentimes exert yourself or suffer [[Health#Injury|injuries]]. Unless magic or advanced technology are available, resting is required to recover from overexertion and injuries.

There are multiple types of rest, depending on the time you spend and the environment you rest within.

### Short Rest
A short rest is a [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Scene|scene]] where you take a breather, and usually lasts a couple of hours.

You can take a short rest as many times as you want during a day, but not in consecutive [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Scene|scenes]].

###### Natural Healing (extended)

### Long Rest
A long rest takes approximately a [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Quarter Days|quarter day]] and can take place during adventuring.

You can take a long rest only once per [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping|day]]. If you are in a protected environment, you can instead take a long rest that lasts for 2 quarter days. This vastly increases the benefits of your rest.

If a long rest is interrupted, you do not gain its benefits.

A long rest is considered a [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Scene|scene]] of its own.

### Relaxed Rest
A relaxed rest is taken during downtime and counts a one [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Downtime Activities|downtime activity]] that can only be combined with other non-strenuous downtime activities.

If a relaxed rest is interrupted, you gain the benefits of an extended [[#Long Rest|long rest]] instead.
