The Deck of Dragons, usually simply referred to as the Deck, the High Arcana, or the Arcana, is composed of the basic building blocks of the world's mythology and mystical life.
Each card represents one of the **Paths of Life**, an archetypal path of power and achievement: a style, a mode of behaviour, or a philosophy of life that you may pursue.

There is no mandate that you follow a path, or if you do that you follow only a single one - even paths that seem mutually exclusive.
