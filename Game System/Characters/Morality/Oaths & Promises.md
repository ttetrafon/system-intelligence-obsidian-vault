Oaths and promises have a certain kind of power all their own - that's the reason they are so highly regarded among the beings of the supernatural community.

Whenever you break a promise sworn on your own power, some of your energy that went into forming that promise feeds back on the oath breaker. For most people, that's not an issue since it just causes a mild discomfort. For magic creatures and spellcasters though, the effect can be devastating.

When you do so, you suffer one or more levels of ‚ùómagic backlash immediately, based on the strength and the importance of the promise. Furthermore, one or more (depending on the specific oath) random attributes of yours are immediately and automatically reduced by 1 step.
