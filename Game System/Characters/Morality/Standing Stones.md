The standing stones are structures devoted to the [[Deck of Dragons]]. A standing stone is always tied to a single [[Deck of Dragons#^33eef7|Path]] and can be used to provide a relevant perk to anyone that prays on it. You can have only one of the standing stone perks active at any time; if you gain another you immediately lose the previous one.

Standing stones tend to appear spontaneously in any world that communities exist (minimum ‚ùóworld ML of 7). They usually evolve as intelligent life flourishes in an area. They always appear in specific biomes, depending on the ideology they reflect.
