Perks are special abilities that augment your [[../Attributes/Attributes|attributes]], [[../Aspects/Aspects|aspects]], and/or any other [[../Characteristics/Characteristics|characteristic]]. They are gained through your life experiences, although sometimes you may train to gain one.
Perks provide a variety of bonuses or alter how things work for you.

### Perk Level/Score
Perks, like [[../Attributes/Attributes|attributes]] and [[../Aspects/Aspects|aspects]], have a score. Sometimes, they feature a minimum score, which is the score you must train to until you gain the perk's benefits.
This score, like other [[../../Gameplay/Resources/Resources|resources]], is in the form of N (dX), and defines the level of the perk at the same time.
> For example, Timeless Body is Su 5, which means it is of ML 5 and requires training up to 

A perk's score also applies as a [[../../Gameplay/Bonuses & Penalties/Bonuses & Penalties|bonus/penalty]] of the same size where applicable.
