## [[../../../../Game System/Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Ex|Ex]]/[[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Su|Su]]/[[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Te|Te]] V/X ([[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Healing|healing]])
Your ability to recover from injuries is uncanny.
You can make one [[../Attributes/Attributes#Body|body]] and one [[../Attributes/Attributes#Mind|mind]] recovery check once per [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Turn|turn]].
At **rank X*** you can attempt a recovery check for every injured [[../Attributes/Attributes|attribute]].

Regeneration is always accompanied by a specific [[../Health/Health#Damage Immunity, Resistance, & Vulnerability|vulnerability]]. If you take damage from your vulnerability, your regeneration is suppressed for that round.
