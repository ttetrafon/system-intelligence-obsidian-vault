You are naturally resistant to all [[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Su|magical]] effects and damage.
Whenever an invoker, including yourself, attempts to affect you with magic, they suffer a [[../../Gameplay/Bonuses & Penalties/Bonuses & Penalties|penalty]] on their [[../../Adventuring/Occult/Occult#Spellcasting|spellcraft]] check equal to your SR.

You ignore spell resistance only when using personal abilities that are from the same origin with your spell resistance.
> A demon lord has natural spell resistance IX. They also can invoke various effects, like ❗haste, naturally. When doing so, they will ignore their SR.
> But if they try to use a normal spell to cast a beneficial effect on them, they will need to overcome the IX (1d20+1d8) penalty to their spellcraft check.

You can also choose to suppress your SR from most sources, for as much time as you want. You must decide this at the start of a [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping|turn/encounter/scene/etc]] and it lasts for that time.
