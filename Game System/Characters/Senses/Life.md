You can perceive the life force of creatures, even the [[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Undead|undead]] and the [[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Construct|constructed]] ones. You can use this vision mode to follow a creature's ❗psychic trail. You can perceive the life force of creatures behind all barriers, although [[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Living|living things]], like foliage, block this type of vision.

Life sources appear as ghostly auras of different colours. Their colour determines their general type, blue for [[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Living|living creatures]], orange for [[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Construct|constructs]], and green for [[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Undead|undead]].

You can identify different shades, with their intensity correlating directly to their life experience ([[../Tiers/Experience Tier (ET)|ET]]); the most vibrant ones belonging to the most experienced creatures.

The target's age desaturates a life aura to the point it looks washed-out despite still being vibrant.

Furthermore, this sense paints differently the living creature [[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Descriptors (Tags)#Creature Types|types]] and [[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Descriptors (Tags)#Creature Subtypes|subtypes]], meaning you can easily differentiate between them.
