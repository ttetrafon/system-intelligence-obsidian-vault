You can sense the presence of [[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Spirit|spirits]], both in adjacent ❗planes of existence and while they are ❗possessing corporeal creatures.
You also get a sense of ❗teleportation paths, as well as passages and rifts to the [[../../../World/Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Spirit (Aether)/Spirit (Aether)|Spirit (Aether) World]].
Finally, you can extend your spirit sense into the Spirit World, allowing your other senses to pierce the barrier between the worlds and get glimpses of the Spirit World itself, but at the same time your perception in the Material Plane is limited (disadvantage on all [[../Attributes/Perception (PER)|PER]] checks).

Spirit sense is blocked by solid materials, even transparent ones.
