You can perceive the thought patterns of other creatures, even [[../../Gameplay/Descriptors (Tags)/Unintelligent|unintelligent]] ones (you just get compulsions from them).
Thanks to this vision, you gain advantage on all opposed checks against creatures you can perceive through this vision mode, although you can focus only on a single creature to gain this benefit.
This vision mode cannot be used to perceive the environment at all, only creatures.
You can use this sense to follow a creature's ❗psychic trail.

Barriers of all types block this sense.
