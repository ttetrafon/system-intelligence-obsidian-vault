By making contact with your skin, fingers, whiskers, and so on you can identify the material, shape, hardness, temperature, etc of whatever you are touching.

If the sense of touch gains a longer than ❗immediate ❗range, it allows you to notice even the tiniest vibrations in any solid or liquid surface/volume you are in contact with. You can then translate them into an image of your surroundings. When this is the case, you can identify moving creatures through this, as long as they remain in contact with the same surface with you.

This sense can also be used to find secret doors and passages easily, and ignores barriers, although it can never detect anything not in direct contact with the same surface as you.
