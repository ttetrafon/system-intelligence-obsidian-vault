Your (experience) tier has a numerical value of 0, I, II, III, IV, V, VI, etc. It determines your general experience and renown all over the world and directly affects your checks against challenges of different tiers.

For each point of difference between your own tier and your challenge's tier you gain/suffer an equal [[../../Checks & Dice/Bonuses & Penalties/Experience|experience]] [[../../Checks & Dice/Checks & Dice#Advantage & Disadvantage|advantage/disadvantage]] on your check.
> For example fighting against a tier IV guard while you are still tier I will impose disadvantage 3 on all your checks.

After every successful adventure you make a task [[../../Gameplay & Timekeeping/Gameplay & Timekeeping#Tasks (Long-Term Activities)|progress check]] to increase your ET.
