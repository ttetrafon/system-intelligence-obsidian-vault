Your MA describes how much you know about magic in general.

When attempting any check against magic, you compare your MA with the target's ❗ML. If your MA is lower, you suffer the difference as disadvantages on your check.
> Your current ML is 6, and you want to cast a ML 8 spell. This means you suffer disadvantage 2 to your Spellcraft check.

At the end of each adventure, if you have interacted with magic extensively, and at least a few times the target magic was of higher ML than your MA, you may make an [[../../Gameplay/Resources#Accumulation|accumulation]] check to increase your MA.
