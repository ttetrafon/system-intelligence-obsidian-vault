Your (experience) tier has a numerical value of 0, I, II, III, IV, V, VI, etc. It determines your general experience and renown all over the world and directly affects your checks against challenges of different tiers.

For each point of difference between your own MT and your challenge's MT you gain an automatic increase/descresae of your [[../../Checks & Dice/Checks & Dice#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|DoS]] on all checks.
>You are fighting a [[../../Checks & Dice/Descriptors/High Dragon|High Dragon]], which is a mythic creature (MT 2). You, being a typical, albeit experienced adventurer, you suffer a -2 DoS on all your checks concerning the dragon.

- [!] Note that the effects of  [[Experience Tier (ET)|ET]] and MT are independent, and they apply on the same checks in order.
