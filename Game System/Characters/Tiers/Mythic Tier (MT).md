Your (mythic) tier has a numerical value of 0, I, II, III, IV, V, VI, etc.

For each point of difference between your own MT and your challenge's MT you gain an automatic increase/descrease of your [[../../Gameplay/Gameplay#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|DoS]] on all checks.
> You are fighting a [[../../Checks & Dice/Descriptors/High Dragon|High Dragon]], which is a mythic creature (MT 2). You, being a typical, albeit experienced adventurer, you suffer a -2 DoS on all your checks concerning the dragon.

- [!] Note that the effects of  [[Experience Tier (ET)|ET]] and MT are independent, and they apply on the same checks in order.
