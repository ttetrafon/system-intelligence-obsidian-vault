Your TK escribes how much you know about technology in general.

When attempting any check against technology, you compare your TK with the target's ❗TL. If yourσ TK is lower, you suffer the difference as disadvantages on your check.

At the end of each adventure, if you have interacted with technology extensively, and at least a few of these instances where concerning technology of greater ❗TL than your TK, you may make an [[../../Gameplay/Resources#Accumulation|accumulation]] check to increase your TK.
