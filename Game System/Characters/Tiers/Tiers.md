Tiers describe your level of experience and/or expertise.

Each tier is a [[../Attributes/Attributes|attribute]], but only its [[../Attributes/Attributes#Mod|mod]] comes into play, the score is important only towards gaining experience.
When you are supposed to increase a tier, you make a [[../../Gameplay & Timekeeping/Gameplay & Timekeeping#Tasks (Long-Term Activities)|task progress]] check against the current score.
- [N] Note that tiers do not have a maximum score, so their progress is infinite.
