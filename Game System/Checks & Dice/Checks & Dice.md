Whenever you want to do something non-trivial, a check is required. Actions are performed by rolling a d% check and comparing the result with the target difficulty.

# Success & Failure
The level success or failure is determined by comparing your d% and your current score (skill, characteristic, etc). The lower you roll, the better your check is.

#### Regular Success (1)
If you roll under or equal to your current score, you succeeded on your task.

#### Difficult Success (2)
If you roll under 3/4 of your current score, you get a difficult success on your task.

#### Hard Success (3)
If you roll under 1/2 of your current score, you get a hard success on your task.

#### Extreme Success (4)
If you roll under 1/4 of your current score, you get an extreme success on your task.

#### Critical Success (5)
If you roll under 1/10, you get a critical success on your task.

#### Impossible Success (6)
If you roll under 1/50, you get an impossible success on your task.

#### Failure
If you roll over your current score, you fail on your task.

#### Fumble
If you roll above 90 + 1/10 of your current score, you have failed spectacularly on your task, which means you don't only fail at the task at hand but you also suffer additional consequences.
> Fumbling when searching a room may result in you leaving behind some evidence of you searching it, fumbling a lockpick check may result in breaking the lock mechanism in a way that it can't even be opened with its key, fumbling on an acrobatic stunt may result in an injury, and so on.

- [!]  The maximum success number, regardless of your score is 99. You always fail a check at 100. You do not fumble on 100 if your current score is 99 or above.

- [!] To calculate the check thresholds above, round down during the calculations. 

### Extra Success Effects
If you get a better success rate than the one required by the task at hand you gain additional benefits.
> For example, you are trying to charm a guard to allow you to enter in a restricted facility. You scored a hard success though, so the guard not only allows you to enter the facility but also provides you with information on how to avoid the guard patrols within or gives you visitor named tags so you can avoid secondary identity checks if you are caught.

### Limited Success
Sometimes you may fail. In these occasions you may decide that you succeeded instead but suffer a drawback; you can decide what the consequence is, but the GM must approve of this.
> While climbing on a mountain you have reached a very difficult stretch on the path to move through. You make your athletics check but you fail. You can declare that you succeeded to climb the stretch but you lost your rope during your attempt or you suffered some harm, thinking that proceeding on your path is better than failing.

### Retrying: Changing Approach
Many times during your adventuring, you may fail to do something. In such cases, you can attempt to change how you approached the solution. You may retry, as long as you have the time to do so and you can describe how you are approaching the task at hand differently than before. The change can be either internal or external, meaning that you may use a different method (different Attribute) or the situation has changed somehow.
> For example, you may have failed a TEC check to unlock a door, trying with your lockpicks to force the lock open. You may decide that you will take a more logical

## Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)
The difficulty is determined by the situation at hand, and is similar to a check's success level; **trivial** (failure), **regular**, **difficult**, **hard**, **extreme**, **critical**, and **impossible**.
> Balancing on a tight rope usually requires a hard success, while balancing on the same rope while a strong wind is blowing requires an extreme success. Avoiding the attack of a viper requires a hard success on your Dodge, but avoiding a street urchin's attempt to hit you with its fists is a trivial action.

The degree of success of a check is equal to the number of steps you achieved besides the check's difficulty, including the initial difficulty.
> For example, if you roll an extreme success and the difficulty is regular the degree of success is 3, while if you rolled an impossible success against critical difficulty the degree of success is 2.


# Advantage & Disadvantage
In both cases. for each advantage or disadvantage you roll one additional tens die and keep the best (lowest) or the worst (highest) one respectively to determine your result.
> For example, you are making a spellcraft check (score 75) with advantage 1. You roll one additional tens die for 20, 80, and 6, so your result is 26 for an extreme success.
> Later, you suffer a -2 penalty. You roll two additional tens dice for 30, 50, 70, and 3. You keep the worst, which results in a check of 73, a regular success for your score.

Advantages and disadvantages are added together to determine the final bonus or penalty on your check.
> If you gained at advantage 3 and disadvantage 2, then your check would enjoy at advantage 1.


# Mentors
Adventuring with more experienced people is always helpful. When you make checks that another character in your group is better at, you gain [[#Advantage & Disadvantage|advantage]] on your check. Your mentor does not need to be present at the time of the check; it's just that you are picking the know-how from them due to proximity.


# Opposed Checks

## Active
When you are attempting an opposed check, you make your check normally. Your opponent also makes a check normally.
The one with the better result wins. A tie either means that nothing happens or goes to the initiator of the action where appropriate.

## Passive
You make a check normally, but the difficulty is derived by the opponent's stats.
- **Trivial**: 1-20
- **Regular**: 21-50
- **Difficult**: 51-75
- **Hard**: 76-100
- **Extreme**: 101-150
- **Critical**: 151-200
- **Impossible**: 201+


# Check Chains
Sometimes you need to make multiple different checks to succeed on a task because each one of them is required to perform the next.

You make checks in order against the same [[#Success & Failure|difficulty]]. Failure in these checks imposes a cumulative [[#Advantage & Disadvantage|disadvantage]] on subsequent checks.


# Group Checks
Many actions are taken by the whole group simultaneously. This comes into play often during skill challenges, like overland travel and diplomatic encounters.
In these cases all individuals must attempt a roll and gather the results in a pool. You start by cancelling the best success with the worst failure, until only successes or failures are left. The best success or the worst failure at this point determines how well the group has done on the task.

> You are trying to sneak past some sentries as a group. All of you make a stealth check and get the following results: regular success, critical success, fumble, failure, and difficult success. After the critical success cancels the fumble and the difficult success cancel's the failure, you are left with a regular success, which means that you managed to sneak past the guards.


# Cooperative Rolls (Help Others)
One or more characters can attempt to help you when you are performing an action if possible, as long as they are trained to do similar stuff; although they can still be not as well trained as you.
Such actions require that all cooperating characters take the same time to perform the action.
In some circumstances, having helpers reduces the total time required for the action.
Each helper makes a single check and provides a +1d10 [[Bonuses & Penalties/Synergy|synergy](Bonuses%20&%20Penalties/Synergy.md) [[Bonuses & Penalties/Bonuses & Penalties|bonus](Bonuses%20&%20Penalties/Bonuses%20&%20Penalties.md) to the main character's check on both a success or failure. On a helper's failure though, the main character suffers a consequence/drawback on their action.


# Synergising Checks
Sometimes, you and your allies may take a similar action at the same time. In these cases you all gain a +1d6 synergy bonus for each ally synergising after the first (2 allies gain +1d6, 3 allies gain +2d6, …). The bonus is valid only the synergising characters are within some appropriate distance to actually synergise on the action you are currently undertaking.
When the action you are undertaking is opposed by a number of, fewer than you, enemies, the synergy bonus is calculated by the difference between your own numbers and theirs.
> For example, during combat your group of 4 adventures has engaged the 2 guards in front of the evil mage's lair. You all gain a +2d6 synergy bonus on your attacks as long as you are all within immediate distance.


# Careful Action (Taking Time)
When you can take your time to perform an action, or when you are not under immediate threat, you gain [[#Advantage & Disadvantage|advantage]] on your check.


# Untrained Checks and Background
A lot of times you can attempt checks towards tasks that you do not have trained in properly. You make these checks with one (for ❗simple skills❗) or double (for ❗complex skills❗) [[#Advantage & Disadvantage|disadvantage]].
> As a modern person of the 20th century, you know how to drive but you never gave it much thought. Suddenly you find yourself into a mountain road with a rock avalanche rolling towards you. You can still attempt drive checks to avoid the falling rocks and survive, but you do so by rolling with double disadvantage on your score.
> If you are currently training on something, you instead suffer single disadvantage on related actions.


# Multitasking
Sometimes you may need to perform some action while doing something else. When the actions are mutually exclusive, you must succeed on a [concentration](onenote:#Self&section-id={F4B5F533-AED8-4749-B5F7-808512A72D86}&page-id={C2432494-44A6-4068-96AB-B91A31A30D32}&object-id={0C8E2107-FFD3-0AA5-2762-F1555ECD381B}&25&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/73fbda111a4ef6fc/Documents/System%20Intelligence/Game%20System.one) check to take all of them. The difficulty of this concentration check is determined by the number of different actions you are trying to take.
- **regular**: 2 actions
- **difficult**: 3 actions
- **hard**: 4 actions
- **extreme**: 5 actions
- **critical**: 7 actions
- **impossible**: 10 actions
When the actions are similar, you do not need a concentration check but instead suffer disadvantage on all your actions, at a rate of one disadvantage per extra action after the first.
