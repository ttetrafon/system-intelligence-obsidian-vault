An aberration has a bizarre anatomy, strange abilities, and alien mindset, or any combination of the three.
Aberrations are usually plain weird. They are either the results of magical experiments, or, more often than not, the result of the influence of magical energies on the mundane world.
The most bizarre of the aberrations actually originated in the [[../../../../World/Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Far Realm (Void)/Far Realm (Void)|Far Realm]], or has been created by the [[../../../../World/Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Far Realm (Void)/Far Realm (Void)|Far Realm's]] energies spilling into the [[../../../../World/Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Prime/Prime|Prime]] or the [[../../../../World/Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Spirit (Aether)/Spirit (Aether)|Spirit World]].
