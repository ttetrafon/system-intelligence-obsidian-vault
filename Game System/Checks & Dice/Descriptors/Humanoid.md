A humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and one head, or more generally, a human-like torso, arms, and a head.
Humanoids usually can speak and have well-developed societies.
A humanoid may sometimes have some monstrous characteristics, like extreme size or animal appendages, or has huge variations in size, but its general shape remains the same.
