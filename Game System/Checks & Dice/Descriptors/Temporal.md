All effects that have to do with time.

Time travel and affecting the past magically are both quite limited though. There is a quality similar to inertia at work. Once an event has occurred, there is an extremely strong tendency for that event to occur no matter what. The larger, more significant, or more energetic the event, the more it tends to remain as it originally happened, despite any interference.
