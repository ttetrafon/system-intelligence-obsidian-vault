Your wealth is a [[../../Gameplay/Resources/Resources|recourse]] that gets spent/increased during your life.

# Daily Expenses
At the start of each [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Cycle (week)|cycle]] you must decide how much money you will spend to support your lifestyle. This choice does not directly affects your statistics and abilities, but sometimes it will be translated in a [[../../Gameplay/Bonuses & Penalties/Bonuses & Penalties|bonus/penalty]] (equal to the difference), depending on the situation.

|  lifestyle   | expenditure target |
|:------------:|:------------------:|
|   wretched   |         0          |
|   squalid    |         1          |
|     poor     |         3          |
|    modest    |         5          |
| comfortable  |         8          |
|   wealthy    |         12         |
| aristocratic |         17         |
|    kingly    |         23         |
|   mythical   |         30         |

# Profession
You can practice almost any [[../../Characters/Aspects/Aspects|aspect]] you are proficient with as a profession and earn a living from it. You must spend at least half a day, five days a week, to earn a living. Anything less is usually not enough.

At the end of every [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Cycle (week)|cycle]] you can make a [[../../Gameplay/Resources/Resources#Accumulation|wealth accumulation check]] with difficulty derived from the type of skill used, plus any other modifiers due to the importance of the chosen profession in the area, its rarity, and other circumstances.

# Currency
Many different currencies can be encountered around the cosmos.
Their base value is determined by how much a person needs to survive comfortably over a [[../../Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Cycle (week)|cycle]].

|     AOI      | The universal currency employed by the precursors.<br><br>It is based on the intrinsic properties of the Matrix, and as such it is the most stable and distributable coin that ever existed.<br><br>Any civilization that manages to tap into the Matrix, sooner or later adopts the use of the AOI credits; a purely electronic form of exchange. |           -            |
| Keeping (KG) | ❗Virga's Keping coins are so widely used across the world that they are accepted almost everywhere, usually at a quite good exchange rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |           +2           |

## Exchange Rates
Different currencies have different values.

Translating your wealth to another currency is an immediate change on your wealth die, either increasing or decreasing it.
> For example, if your current wealth in AOI is equal to 4, changing your wealth to KG will result in you having a wealth of 6. After spending money, you end with KG 5, which you then change again to AOI 3.

Commodities also may suffer changes when used as currency in different regions.
