You may gain one or more bonuses or suffer one or more penalties on an action. Each bonus/penalty makes your action easier/more difficult.
Bonuses and penalties are in the form of ***XdN***. You make your [[../Gameplay|check]] as normal, and then roll the bonuses or penalties and increase or reduce the total result the same way your normal check works.

Bonuses and penalties are usually derived directly by the [[../Gameplay#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|DoS]] of another check or some other value, at the following rate:
1. 1d4
2. 1d6
3. 1d8
4. 1d10
5. 1d12
6. 1d20
7. 1d20+1d4
8. 1d20+1d6
9. 1d20+1d8
10. 1d20+1d10
11. 1d20+1d12
12. 2d20
13. 2d20+1d4
14. 2d20+1d6
15. 2d20+1d8
16. 2d20+1d10
17. 2d20+1d12
18. 3d20
19. 3d20+1d4
20. â€¦

## Bonus/Penalty Types
Each bonus or penalty has a specific type.
Bonuses or penalties of the same type do not stack, only the highest applies, but different types are rolled separately.

> For example, a magical cloak you wear provides you a +2 enhancement bonus on your thievery checks. A companion of yours casts a spell that makes hiding more effective, providing an enhancement bonus of +3. When trying to infiltrate the camp of your enemies you only benefit from the +3 bonus (1d8).

If you have a bonus or penalty of the same type simultaneously, you use their difference to find out if you gain a bonus or suffer a penalty on your actions.

> You are still wearing your magical cloak that provides a +2 enhancement bonus on your thievery checks, but you are trying to hide from your pursuers in the town square under an effect that outlines you with magical light which imposes a -4 penalty on your thievery checks. This means that you suffer a -2 (1d6) enhancement penalty on your final roll.
