Whenever you want to do something non-trivial, a check is required. Actions are performed by rolling a check and comparing the result with the target [[Checks & Dice#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|difficulty]].

# Check Success & Failure
A check is made with a number of dice, usually including an [[../Characters/Attributes/Attributes|attribute]], an [[../Characters/Aspects/Aspects|aspect]], and sometimes one of your [[../Characters/Morality|morals]].
You roll all dice together but consider each one independently. For each 3 full points in each one you count 1 success (or reduce 1 for penalty dice).
The total of these individual results is your check result.
> For example, you rolled 1d10+1d6+1d4 and got 7, 3, 4 respectively, which are +2 +1 +1=4 successes in total.

Note that sometimes the moral check may be a hindrance, meaning that you subtract the number of successes on that die from your total.

# Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)
Most often, your check must meet or surpass some difficulty. The difficulty is subtracted by your check's total to calculate the total successes. This final number is the **degree of success**, if positive or zero, or the **degree of failure**, if negative.

| Difficulty  | Target | Description                                                             |
|:-----------:|:------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   routine   |   0    | Anyone can do this basically every time.                                |
|   simple    |   1    | Typical task requiring focus. Most people can usually do this.          |
|  standard   |   2    | Requires full attention. Post people have a mediocre chance to succeed. |
|  demanding  |   3    | Trained people have a 50/50 chance to succeed.                          |
|  difficult  |   4    | Even trained people will fail sometimes.                                |
| challenging |   6    | Gifted people with training have some chance of success.                |
| formidable  |   8    | Even highly trained people almost never succeed.                        |
| impossible  |   10   | Impossible without great effort or extremely specialised training.      |
|   heroic    |   12   | A task worthy of tales for years afterwards.                            |
|  immortal   |   15   | A task worthy of legends that last lifetimes.                           |
|   deific    |   20   | A task that only the divines have hopes to succeed on.                  |
## Extra Success Effects
If you get a better success rate than the one required by the task at hand you gain additional benefits. The number of extra effects equals to the degree of success of your check.
> For example, you are trying to charm a guard to allow you to enter in a restricted facility, which is a demanding task. You scored 5 successes though, so the guard not only allows you to enter the facility but also provides you with information on how to avoid the guard patrols within and gives you visitor named tags so you can avoid secondary identity checks if you are caught.

## Limited Success
Sometimes you may fail but you would prefer not to. In these occasions you may decide that you succeeded instead but suffer a number of drawbacks equal to your DoF; you can decide what the consequences are yourself, but the GM must approve of these.
> While climbing on a mountain you have reached a difficult (4) stretch on the path to move through. You make your athletics check but you fail by 1. You can declare that you succeeded to climb the stretch but you lost your rope during your attempt or you suffered some harm, thinking that proceeding on your path is better than failing.

## Retrying: Changing Approach
Many times during your adventuring, you may fail to do something. In such cases, you can attempt to change how you approached the solution. You may retry, as long as you have the time to do so and you can describe how you are approaching the task at hand differently than before. The change can be either internal or external, meaning that you may use a different method (different attribute or aspect) or the situation has changed somehow.
> For example, you may have failed a TEC check to unlock a door, trying with your lockpicks to force the lock open. You may decide that you will take a more analytical approach and roll with REA instead.

# Mentors
Adventuring with more experienced people is always helpful. When you make checks that another character in your group is better at, you gain a +1 synergy bonus on your check. Your mentor does not need to be present at the time of the check; it's just that you are picking the know-how from them due to proximity.

# Opposed Checks
When you are attempting an opposed check, you make your check normally. Your opponent also makes a check normally.
The one with the better [[Checks & Dice#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|DoS]] wins. A tie either means that nothing happens or goes to the initiator of the action where appropriate.
*For a player facing game, players may roll their opponents' checks as [[Bonuses & Penalties/Bonuses & Penalties|penalties]] on their own checks.*

# Check Chains
Sometimes you need to make multiple different checks to succeed on a task because each one of them is required to perform the next.
You make checks in order against the same difficulty. Success or failure in these checks impose a  [[Bonuses & Penalties/Situational|situational bonus/penalty]] equal to the [[Checks & Dice#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|DoS/DoF]] respectively.

# Group Checks
Many actions are taken by the whole group simultaneously. This comes into play often during skill challenges, like ❗overland travel, ❗diplomatic encounters, [[../Equipment/Crafting/Crafting|crafting]], and so on.
In these cases all individuals must attempt a roll and gather the results in a pool. You start by cancelling the best success with the worst failure, until only successes or failures are left. The best success or the worst failure at this point determines how well the group has done on the task.
> You are trying to sneak past some sentries as a group. All of you make a stealth check and get the following results: 1, 4, -3, -2, and 1. After the 4 cancels the -3 and the 1 cancel's the -2, you are left with a 1, which means that you managed to sneak past the guards effectively.

# Cooperative Rolls (Help Others)
One or more characters can attempt to help you when you are performing an action if possible, as long as they are trained to do similar stuff; although they can still be not as well trained as you.
Such actions require that all cooperating characters take the same time to perform the action. In some circumstances, having helpers reduces the total time required for the action.

Each helper can augment your check in one of the following ways:
- Replace any of your [[../Characters/Attributes/Attributes|attribute]] or [[../Characters/Aspects/Aspects|aspect]] scores with their own, if theirs is better.
- Provide a [[Bonuses & Penalties/Bonuses & Penalties|bonus die]] from any relevant to the task [[../Characters/Aspects/Aspects|aspect]] they possess.
- Reduce the time required by the [[#Tasks (Long-Term Activities)|task]] at hand appropriately.

# Combined Checks
Sometimes, you and your allies will perform the same action at the same time, so that the result is greater than its parts.
> For example, attacking a resilient foe simultaneously so the total of your attacks has a chance to bypass their defences can be a combined check.

In this case start by the greater degree of success, and then add half the other degrees of success (min +1).

# Careful Action (Taking Time) & Trivial Actions
When you can take your time to perform an action, or when you are not under immediate threat, you are considered to have rolled the maximum possible result for your current scores.
If the difficulty of the check is lower than your maximum possible [[#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|DoS]], you succeed automatically.

# Untrained Checks
A lot of times you can attempt checks towards tasks that you do not have trained in properly. You make these checks with a 1d12 experience penalty.

Generally, you may attempt untrained checks in for tasks you may have some exposure to due to your background, way of like, or even the time period you live in.
> As a modern person of the 20th century, you know how to drive but you never gave it much thought. Suddenly you find yourself into a mountain road with a rock avalanche rolling towards you. You can still attempt road vehicle checks to avoid the falling rocks and survive, but you do so by rolling with a -2 experience penalty.

You can usually attempt untrained checks with [[../Characters/Aspects/Aspects|aspects]] that belong to the same category with any [[../Characters/Aspects/Aspects|aspect]] you already have a score of d10 or more.

- [N] If you are currently training on something, you instead suffer a 1d8 penalty instead.

# Multitasking
Sometimes you may need to perform some action while doing something else. When the actions are mutually exclusive, you suffer a cumulative 1 [[Bonuses & Penalties/Synergy|synergy penalty]] for each action you are performing.
> You are driving your bike while being followed and shot at by a rival gang's car. You are simultaneously zip within the traffic and shoot your pistol towards them, which means you suffer a -2 synergy penalty in both your drive and combat checks.

# Tasks (Long-Term Activities)
A task is a complex endeavour that takes time and requires multiple checks.

###### Time Interval
Tasks take time which is split into time intervals. These vary, from a few seconds each to centuries, depending on the task at hand.

###### Complexity
Each task is described by its complexity, which is a specific die (like a resource).

###### Progress
Progress on a task starts at 0. At the end of each [[#Time Interval|time interval]], you make a resource accumulation check with a target equal to the DoS of a relevant check increased by your tier.
The task is finished when your [[#Progress|progress]] reaches the task's [[#Complexity|complexity]].
