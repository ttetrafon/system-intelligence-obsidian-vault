Elementals are creatures native to the [[../../../../World/Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Spirit (Aether)/Deep Spirit World|Deep Spirit World]]. They are pure creatures with alien mindsets. Each one corresponds to at least one element.
Elementals cannot usually leave the [[../../../World/Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Spirit (Aether)/Spirit (Aether)|Spirit World]] without help. When are summoned they adopt their summoner's mindset, and if destroyed they return to the [[../../../World/Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Spirit (Aether)/Spirit (Aether)|Aether]], practically unharmed.
