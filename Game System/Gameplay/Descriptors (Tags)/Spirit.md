Spirits are all the creatures that spawn in the [[../../../World/Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Spirit (Aether)/Spirit (Aether)|Spirit World]], be it ❗demons, ❗devils, ❗fey, and so on. These are all patterns that exist by forming vessels for themselves by the energy of the planes itself. This also describes all effects related to the patterns, or souls, of all creatures.

- A spirit, being an energy manifestation, cannot appear on its own on the prime world, instead it needs to ❗possess a vessel there.
Possession can happen though only in two ways, a vessel wills the possession to happen or the vessel has been marked by the spirit while it was possessing another vessel. Marking a vessel needs to be done in a way that signifies the spirit in question.
> For example, a ghoul which is a spirit of death, fear, and pain, can mark a vessel by biting on its living flesh. Similarly, a succubus, a spirit of lust, can mark a vessel by having sexual intercourse with it.
- Spirits always spawn with a connection to the [[../../../World/Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Prime/Prime|Material world]], either physical or sentimental. A spirit of water would spawn where an overlapping body of water exists in the Material World, while a spirit of death will spawn where a battlefield exists in the Material World.
- A spirit loses its powers when its spawn place or ideology deteriorates, and eventually disappears if the spawn is destroyed.
- A spirit can be bound within an inanimate object, but the object must be crafted from a material the spirit is vulnerable to.
