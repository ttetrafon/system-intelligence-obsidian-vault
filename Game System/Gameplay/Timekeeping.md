Time keeping sets the pace of the game. The game is split into two distinctive parts, adventuring and downtime.

### Quarter Days
Usually, there is no need to keep precise timing of everything that happens during a game. Apart from the normal calendar used in the area of adventuring (days, weeks, months, years), a useful abstraction is to split the day in four parts, each one called a **quarter day**.
- morning
- afternoon
- evening
- night
With this in mind you can easily calculate how fast the time passes when the adventurers do their stuff.

### Cycle (week)
The most important time measure is the cycle. A cycle denotes a time period of about one week on Earth. Large scale events and actions, like crafting and organisation evolution, always happen between cycles.
Cycles are tightly tied to [[#Downtime|downtime periods]].

### Month
A number of cycles, usually 4-5, comprise a month.

### Year
Usually defined as a full circle of a planet around a start, a year includes a specific number of months and cycles.

# Timers (Clocks)
A simple way to create tension is to use timers. These are abstract countdowns that run out on actions, not on time itself.

To create a timer, first establish what it does and give it a name.

Second, decide how easy or difficult is this to happen, and assign to it a die, from d4 to d20. The size of the counter can also be taken from check results, with the degree of success determining it as follows:
1. d4
2. d6
3. d8
4. d10
5. d12
6. d20
7. d20+d4
8. …

> The players are sneaking in a castle, trying to reach the king's chambers undetected. The timer will be named "Guards Alerted", and when the players have finally caused enough commotion to draw the guards to them. 
> Since it is a normal day and there are people walking throughout the castle, the players are inconspicuous enough, and there is a huge feast tonight for the town people on the Castle's yard, the castle people won't easily notice the players are out of place. The players then make a group check for sneak, and end up with DoS 4, meaning their sneak clock will be a d10.
> From there on, the players will move from encounter to encounter. Resolving each encounter will probably move the timer ahead, one or more steps depending on the situation and resolution.
> 
> The players don't know their way around, so they decide to randomly wander in the corridors until they find their way. They suddenly find their way in a storage room where some workers are packing crates with supplies. A guard in the room immediately apprehends them, but they manage to quick talk their way out of the situation. Still, the guard will remember them and will mention the happening to others in passing, reducing the timer to 9.
> 
> Later, the players are sneaking in the private area of the castle, where a servant hears them skulking and immediately runs off. They don't manage to stop him in time, reducing the timer by a whole 4 points more, from 9 to 5.

This continues either until the timer finishes, at which point what it described happens, changing the situation drastically, or the timer becomes irrelevant.

# Adventuring
The adventuring phase is structured and is when most of player activities happen. The adventuring phases are the following:

### Campaign
A campaign consists of many quests tied together, affecting the same characters under a single plot.
> For example, you have named the campaign you are currently playing Upper Echelon and is the quest of a group of unlikely heroes trying to assume political power for the better or for worse.

### Quest
A quest is a series of scenes, all connected for some reason.
> During this campaign, a quest the players are currently undertaking is to infiltrate the stronghold of a corrupt politician without being noticed, with the purpose of learning his secrets and exposing those secrets to lower the target's political power throughout the nation.

### Scene
A scene is a series of encounters that are all strongly tied together.
> While in the above mission, a scene can be considered the passage through the sewers from the drain the players found outside of the stronghold and up to their entrance through the toilets.

### Encounter
An encounter is a single event or interaction between groups of characters, creatures, and/or the environment.
> While in the tunnels under the stronghold, the players were ambushed by mutant rats which they failed to spot in time. This is an encounter.

#### Encounter Level (EL) 
An encounter level (EL) is equal to the opponents' [[../Characters/Tiers/Experience Tier (ET)|ETs]] total.

#### Party Level (PL)
Similarly, your party level (PL) is equal to your group's [[../Characters/Tiers/Experience Tier (ET)|ETs]] total.

#### Encounter Resolution
An encounter's resolution can be structured when needed; especially when the encounter happens between groups with opposing and/or exclusive goals.
To succeed on an encounter, you take [[#Turn|turns]] until you beat the encounter's [[#Encounter Level (EL)|EL]], fail your goals, lose to your [[#Party Level (PL)|PL]], or withdraw.

### Turn
A turn is a single phase within an encounter. During a turn, decisions are made and actions are attempted. The logic of the turn is to split actions into meaningful groups and not micromanage the passage of time, as it should be at least somewhat abstract like all other resolution mechanics in the game.

All participants describe what they will attempt, in order from lower to higher [[../Characters/Tiers/Tiers|tier]], and make a number of checks equal to their [[../Characters/Tiers/Experience Tier (ET)|ET]].
If tiers are tied, the opponents should first describe what they are doing and the players can go after. Elite opponents instead roll [[#Initiative|initiative]] against the players to decide who goes first.

After all checks are made, the collective [[Gameplay#Difficulty & Degree of Success/Failure (DoS/DoF)|DoS]] of both groups is determined. Each group then uses their own score to either move the [[#Encounter Resolution|encounter's resolution]] towards their own side.
Individual results though apply ❗damage and/or ❗effects to enemies and allies as described in the planning phase, while defensive actions, ❗equipment, and ❗character traits/abilities are used to mitigate ❗damage and ❗effects.

- [N] Sometimes, ❗damage/❗effects applied to specific enemies may result in them falling out of the encounter. In such cases, the [[#Encounter Level (EL)|EL]] and/or [[#Party Level (PL)|PL]] are immediately adjusted as needed.

> The players (tier II) have stumbled upon a raider (4 raiders * tier I = EL 4) checkpoint on a rarely travelled bridge. The encounter begins with the raiders demanding a toll. 

#### Initiative
An initiative check decides when an action happens faster than some other, so it may interrupt or even deny the second action. Depending on the situation, this is a [[../Characters/Attributes/Dexterity (DEX)|DEX]], [[../Characters/Attributes/Reason (REA)|REA]], or [[../Characters/Attributes/Wisdom (WIS)|WIS]] check.

#### Effects & Turns
Non-instantaneous effects that last for multiple turns, encounters, scenes, or even adventures and whose target can shake them off are resolved at the end of each turn/encounter/scene/etc.
> Binding magic have been used against you during this turn denying you of any type of movement. At the end of your turn you can attempt a resolve check to shake the effect off.

#### Surprise
Sometimes an [[#Encounter|encounter]] can begin with some participants not aware of this happening.
In this cases, the unawares cannot take any actions during the first [[#Turn|turn]] of the encounter.

# Downtime
Downtime happens in-between adventuring phases. It is time for free play without much need of checks, and it when players can undertake downtime activities.
Possible activities are [[../Equipment/Crafting/Crafting|crafting]], ❗training, ❗researching, ❗working, ❗recuperating, ❗foraging, ❗scraping, and so on.

Downtime is split in [[#Cycle (week)|cycles]] which are an abstract way to measure the passage of time.

- [I] The number of downtime periods available to you is decided by the GM and may or may not be revealed at the start of downtime.

### Downtime Activities
You are allowed to take a number of downtime activities within each cycle equal to your ❗experience tier (minimum 1). You can take an extra one, but you may suffer from ❗exhaustion at the beginning of the next cycle. If you are already exhausted at the beginning of a downtime cycle, your exhaustion may increase at its end if you perform any downtime activities besides taking only light activities or resting.

*Sometimes downtime periods are intertwined with adventuring, allowing you to progress on your downtime activities while actively adventuring. It's usually better to decide what the players did during their downtime at the end of each cycle, resolving whatever needed as a [[#Planning & Flashbacks|flashback]].*

# Planning & Flashbacks
While adventuring, you need to prepare for your adventures as a player and character both.
Due to the nature of TTRPGs you can never have enough information, and most of the time it's impossible to prepare as the character you are playing would do in a given situation.
To cover for such problems, flashbacks can be introduced at any time during adventuring that a character would make sense to have been prepared for a specific eventuality.
> You are trying to infiltrate a secure compound and during your adventure you are stopped by a guard. At that time you decide that having prepared for the infiltration you may have found about the guards working on security. You recall a flashback, in which you look for information about this specific guard. During the flashback you manage to find some evidence of wrongdoing, resulting in something to use against the guard.

- [!] Anything you do during a flashback may affect you or the world retroactively, albeit at a limited level with the GM having the final say.
