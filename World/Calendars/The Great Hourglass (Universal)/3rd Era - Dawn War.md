> The great expanse ended when a few of the civilisations started expanding when resources on their home-worlds became sparse. The inevitable conflict followed suit. A war begun, a war that every world took part ultimately, a war that span millennia and saw whole systems decimated, many times reduced to dust, dust that would entail the death of any to approach.
> One of the last to enter the war was the Precursors, their true name long lost in history. An once peaceful race of intellectuals, scientists, and magicians, that wanted to be left in peace, turned into the most deadly force ever encountered.
> By using their knowledge, they merged themselves with their machines, creating a force unparalleled by anything in the War. The end drew near at this point. Only a few centuries later, nothing was left behind. Ruins and destroyed worlds can be found now where whole civilizations once flourished. Derelicts floating empty and dead in the Spirit World or the empty space encountered from time to time spell doom to anyone that comes close. What happened to the Precursors though, nobody can tell with certainty, as everything we have found about them was second hand.
