> [!quote|mark] [[../../../NPCs/specific/Evius Zotosh|Evius Zotosh]]<br>History of the Universe
> After the end of the War, some time passed before intelligent life begun to flourish once again, pretty much synchronised between various worlds, within give or take a few tens of thousands years at most, civilizations started emerging once again.
> The dust settled, but the universe has changed a lot. Great expanses of dust now block the paths that once criss-crossed the Universe. Civilizations now flourish far from each other, usually in solitude, until we can locate and make contact with them.
> The remnants of the War can be found everywhere if one knows where to look. The greatest mystery of all remains; the Sanctuary worlds, hidden in plain view, protected by ungodly powers at their centre, from any that attempt to reach them. No-one has ever been able to reach one of these world according to our accounts, or if they did, they never escaped to tell the tale.
