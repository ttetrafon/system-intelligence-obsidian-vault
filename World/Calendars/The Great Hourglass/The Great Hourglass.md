A group of stars at what is perceived as the center of the universe is vaguely hourglass shaped.Â  Some stars point out the general shape, while many others move within orbits that take them between the hourglass' compartments, just like the sand moves in its mundane counterpart.

All civilizations that looked to the sky from the start of time noticed the patterns there and used the celestial hourglass to measure time. That has led to an odd result, every civilization across the world is using the same calendar, or at least can use it as a frame or reference.

Even civilisations located in the [[../../Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Spirit (Aether)/Spirit (Aether)|Aether](../../Cosmology/Planes%20of%20Existence/Spirit%20(Aether)/Spirit%20(Aether).md) or in the [[../../Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Matrix/Matrix|Matrix](../../Cosmology/Planes%20of%20Existence/Matrix/Matrix.md) has been using the same calendar.
