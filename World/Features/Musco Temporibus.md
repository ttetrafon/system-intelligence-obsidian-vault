A form of moss-like plant. Appears where the Ethereal overlaps with the Material in rare occasions. All patches are loosely connected through the [[../Cosmology/Planes of Existence/Spirit (Aether)/Spirit (Aether)|Aether]], forming a hive, albeit without any intelligence at all.
- Anyone that passes nearby a patch of musco temporibus is transferred randomly in time or space.
- The transition is rarely noticed directly.
- Allied groups are transported together.

The flowers, when ready to blossom, emit eerie sounds, not unlike a song. At that time, anyone sleeping in proximity will have strange, alien dreams of other worlds where other patches have grown.
- These dreams cause [[../../Game System/Characters/Attributes/Memory (MEM)|MEM]] and [[../../Game System/Characters/Attributes/Reason (REA)|REA]] [[../../Game System/Gameplay/Timekeeping/Timekeeping#Damage|damage]].
