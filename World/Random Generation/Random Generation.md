# Random Encounters
Each location should have the following list for random encounters generation. Each item should be assigned a range of numbers between 1-20 (1d20) - the default presented below - adjusted as needed depending on the location.
- none: 1
- natural feature: 4
- local flora/fauna: 10
- intelligent life: 16
- unnatural feature: 20


## Tricks 
- Roll multiple times on a creature table to create dynamic and complex encounters.
- Use secondary tables for:
	- monuments and/or locations instead of only creatures
	- conditions, effects, descriptions, and origins, which will somehow affect the encounter
	- factions to determine a connection to the world
	- attitude and behaviour
	- distance, depending on the situation
	- weather
- Build tables for specific locations based on factions, climate, etc.
- When a random encounter doesn't happen, roll one to show that something happened in the area before the players arrived.
