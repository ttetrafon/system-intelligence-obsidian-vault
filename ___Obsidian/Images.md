Images can be inserted by copy-pasting them inside a note. This creates a link and adds the image to the vault (location depends on settings).

The [[Plugins.md#^cfda96|ITS theme]] provides a lot of [extra options](https://publish.obsidian.md/slrvb-docs/ITS+Theme/Image+Adjustments).
Properties are set within the link, after a `|`.
- Max size:
