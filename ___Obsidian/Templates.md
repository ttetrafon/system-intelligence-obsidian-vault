- A template is a preformatted note, ready to be reused anywhere.
	- Templates can be full pages (like a location page), individual elements (a table with specific format), and anything in-between.
- Set the properties in the settings as needed.
- Set the hotkey to add a template (current `Alt + T`).
- When in another note, hit the hotkey, and a list with all available templates will open to choose from.
