You must always succeed on an [[../../../Characters/Aspects/Traversal|Traversal]] check `VIEW[(difficulty {traversal-difficulty})][text]` to successfully do so.
When making any movement related check you suffer a `VIEW[-{speed-penalty}][text]` [[../../../Gameplay/Bonuses & Penalties/Speed|speed]] [[../../../Gameplay/Bonuses & Penalties/Bonuses & Penalties|penalty]].
